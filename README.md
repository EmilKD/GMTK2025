A mini game developed with Unreal Engine 5 (5.4) for GMTK game jam 2025 
- Made with lots of love, passion and coffee :D
- Created in 4 days
- State machine created from scratch for animations
- Spoiler! Featuring a challenging boos fight :D

We finished the development in time, but unfortunately we failed to submit the game due to a last moment internet connection failure :( , but still, we're proud of our little creation 😁.
